House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.
Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to
begin, and let me assure you he will ___DEFINITELY NOT DIE!___

After a brush with death Ned Stark sharpened his blades and his mind. Fixing his gaze on the distant future where his family would be safe, he set off on an impossibly difficult mission. He would save them. ALL of them. Ok, maybe not ALL of them.
